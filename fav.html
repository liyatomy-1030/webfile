       <p>Jesus Christ was a 1st-century Jewish preacher and religious leader, the central figure of Christianity, believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah. Born to Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem around 6-4 BCE, he began his public ministry around age 30 after being baptized by John the Baptist, teaching about God, performing miracles, and gathering followers. After a short ministry of about three years, he was crucified in Jerusalem, but Christians believe he was resurrected three days later and ascended into heaven. <br>

Life and Ministry<br>
Birth and Early Life: Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary and Joseph, with the virgin birth of Jesus being a central tenet of Christian belief. His family lived in Nazareth in Galilee. 
Public Ministry: After his baptism by John the Baptist, Jesus began a public ministry that lasted for about three years. He taught using parables and performed miracles, such as healing the sick and raising the dead, which were seen as signs of his divine power. 
Teachings: His teachings emphasized love, forgiveness, and the importance of following God's will. He also chose 12 disciples to spread his message. 
Crucifixion and Resurrection<br>
Trial and Crucifixion: Jesus's growing influence led to conflict with religious authorities, and he was eventually arrested, tried, and crucified in Jerusalem. 
Resurrection and Ascension: Christians believe that Jesus rose from the dead three days after his crucifixion, reappearing to his followers before ascending into heaven. 
Sources<br>
The primary sources for Jesus's life are the Gospels in the New Testament of the Bible (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), which provide accounts of his birth, teachings, death, and resurrection. 
Non-Christian accounts from Roman and Jewish historians like Tacitus and Flavius Josephus also mention Jesus, providing evidence for his historical existence. </p>
